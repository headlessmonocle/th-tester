					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Stuffing your business name with keywords is no longer an effective idea. Simple keywords wonâ€™t attract your customersâ€™ attention. However, what you can do is modify the words in a creative way, and tell what your business is about without sounding bland. Take common words and change their spelling in an interesting way. Companies like Digg, Compaq, or Flickr, have done a great job when it comes to this. So just sit down and get your creative juices flowing. [&#8230;]]]></description>

Hi Mariel, 

Thanks for your feedback! 

I&#039;m right there with you on the binge-watching. There&#039;s nothing like a good Jaclyn Hill or Chrisspy video to send me into dreams of the perfect winged liner. 

I&#039;ve noticed that many YouTube beauty gurus change once they hit a certain level of fame. Followers definitely respond well to people who they can relate to rather than celebrity-like characters. 

Have a great week! :)]]></description>

Thanks for sharing, Jason! 

I thought it was an extremely interesting concept for the &quot;color to come from the photos&quot; exclusively as well. It really puts the end-user at the focal point of the story. 

It&#039;s the classic reaction I think. I look to Spotify and Uber as case studies. When they both made brand tweaks, the internet lost their collective minds like they did here. I can&#039;t help but wonder if any rebrand to any beloved brand would garner mass praise, or if every brand is destined for mass criticism (at least initially).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Change is good. Frankly, while I liked the old logo, the new one is quite colorful. I appreciated Instagram saying that they want to color to come from your photos, not the background. That is actually the first thing I noticed. It is as if the white border is a frame now. 

But, heaven forbid a brand change their logo without social media approving.]]></description>
